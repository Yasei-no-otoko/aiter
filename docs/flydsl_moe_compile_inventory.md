# FlyDSL standard two-stage MoE compile inventory

## Status and scope

This document records the **current old host path** on
`zhimding/refactor_aot`. It is the behavioral baseline for a future CPU-only
compile-request resolver. It is **not** a Manifest, a proposed source of truth,
or a description of a future dispatch design.

The inventory covers the standard
`fused_moe -> fused_moe_ -> fused_moe_2stages` path and every FlyDSL artifact
reachable from it:

- optional FlyDSL MoE sorting, including oneshot and both multiphase launchers;
- a FlyDSL stage1 or stage2 selected independently by a tuned row or a host
  heuristic;
- stage1 split-K activation/quantization helpers;
- FlyDSL activation epilogues reached from a CK-Tile stage1;
- stage2 plain and expert-parallel masked reduction.

It intentionally excludes the one-stage assembly path, the separate
`flydsl_mxmoe_*`/`aiter.aot.flydsl.mxfp4_moe` port, gfx1250 grouped MoE,
Triton MoE, and standalone kernel tests. Mixed rows are still in scope: for
example, CK stage1 + FlyDSL stage2 and FlyDSL stage1 + CK-Tile or Opus stage2.

```

Builder construction and artifact compilation are distinct. In particular,
`compile_moe_sorting()` calls both sorting builder factories, but only the
launcher selected for the current token range is passed to `flyc.compile`.
The CPU baseline should record the agreed builder-request boundary, not infer
coverage from private FlyDSL cache keys.

## Dispatch and trigger conditions

### Two-stage configuration selection

`get_2stage_cfgs()` owns backend selection.

1. It builds a lookup key from:
   `gfx`, CU count, padded token tier, `model_dim`, `inter_dim`, local expert
   count, routed `topk`, activation, output/activation/weight dtypes,
   quantization type, gate/up shape, and `doweight_stage1`.
   Below 32768 tokens the tier is `nextPow2(M)`; 32768 and 131072 are explicit
   large tiers. In expert-parallel mode the always-masked fake top-k slot is
   removed from the CSV lookup key.
2. It reads `AITER_CONFIGS.AITER_CONFIG_FMOE_FILE`, first trying an exact
   `act_type` row and then the activation-disabled fallback. Rows tagged
   `_tag=flydsl_fallback` are excluded from runtime lookup. A missing large
   tier may fall back to a smaller configured tier.
3. A `kernelName1` or `kernelName2` beginning with `flydsl_` selects the
   corresponding FlyDSL wrapper only when FlyDSL is available. Stages are
   selected independently; the other stage may be CK, CK-Tile, Opus, or
   assembly/HIP.
4. Without a usable tuned row, current heuristics can synthesize FlyDSL names:
   - per-1x32 bf16-activation/int4-weight (`a16wi4`) selects FlyDSL stage1 and
     atomic stage2 when FlyDSL is available;
   - the MX path requires bf16/fp16 output, per-1x32 quantization, fp4/fp8
     activation and weight dtypes, preshuffled gate/up weights (`use_g1u1`),
     `doweight_stage1=False`, FlyDSL availability, and either SwiGLU or
     `AITER_FLYDSL_FORCE=1`. It selects FlyDSL stage1 and atomic stage2.
     `AITER_FLYDSL_FORCE` currently defaults to `1`, so this heuristic is not
     limited to SwiGLU.

The `flydsl_mxmoe_*` name family is intercepted earlier by its separate port
and is outside this inventory.

### Optional FlyDSL sorting

FlyDSL sorting is reached only when all of these are true:

- `AITER_USE_CK_MOE_SORTING != 1`;
- `AITER_USE_FLYDSL_MOE_SORTING == 1`;
- FlyDSL is available;
- no local-top-k-id result is requested;
- the route is not FLAT;
- the specialized `output_aux` route is not requested;
- `moe_sorting_dispatch_policy == 0`.

Otherwise standard sorting defaults to Opus, or to CK when
`AITER_USE_CK_MOE_SORTING=1`. Requesting local top-k IDs or `output_aux`
also forces a non-FlyDSL sorting path. Expert masking is supported by FlyDSL
sorting and becomes the compile-time `has_mask` variant.

Let `T` be `num_local_tokens` when supplied, otherwise `topk_ids.shape[0]`;
`E` is the global routed expert count. With `BLOCK_SIZE=256`:

```text
sub_tokens =
  floor((LDS_ints / 2 / (E + 1) - 2) / 8) * 8

ONESHOT_MAX_T =
  min(sub_tokens, max(16, 256 // max(topk, E // 8)))
```

The LDS size is 163840 bytes on gfx95*, 65536 bytes on gfx94* and the
conservative fallback.

- `T <= min(sub_tokens, ONESHOT_MAX_T)`: compile and launch the oneshot
  artifact. `max_tokens` is `max(T, 8)` rounded up to a multiple of 8.
- above that threshold and `T <= 2048`: compile and launch the combined
  multiphase `P0v2 + P23` artifact.
- `T > 2048`: compile and launch the combined four-kernel
  `ClearWS + P0 + P1 + P23` artifact.

Multiphase requests use `k4_block=256` for `E <= 256`; for
`256 < E <= 512` they use 512 through `T=8192` and 256 above it; larger
expert counts use 256. The other static request fields are `E`, `topk`,
sorting `unit_size`/block-M, and `has_mask`. Architecture and wave size are
implicit builder inputs.

Sorting also owns zero-initialization for atomic stage2. For unmasked reduce
mode it receives an empty `(0, 0)` `moe_buf`, so the sorting kernel has no
output-zeroing work.

## Stage1 compile requests

### Primary GEMM

`_flydsl_stage1_wrapper()` resolves the full kernel name through
`get_flydsl_kernel_params()` and calls `flydsl_moe_stage1()`.
The registry is pre-populated with supported named variants carrying complete
static parameter dictionaries; its fallback suffix parser overlays `_kwN`,
`_fp4`, `_fp8`, and `_sbmN` fields on a known base name.
The stage entry derives the exact tensor dimensions and calls
`compile_flydsl_moe_stage1()` with:

- shape: `model_dim`, `inter_dim`, local `experts`, and runtime `topk`;
- tile/type: `tile_m`, `tile_n`, `tile_k`, `a_dtype`, `b_dtype`,
  and effective `out_dtype`;
- route weighting: `doweight_stage1 = (sorted_weights is not None)`;
- activation/layout: `act`, `gate_mode`, and compile-time bias presence;
- scheduling: `persist_m`, `use_async_copy`, `k_batch`, `waves_per_eu`,
  `b_nt`, `a_scale_one`, `xcd_swizzle`, and `k_wave`;
- padding: `model_dim_pad` and `inter_dim_pad`.

The wrapper hard-codes `use_async_copy=True`; stage1 `persist_m` normalizes to
1 unless a direct caller overrides it. Bias disables wrapper-level padding via
`_get_padding_for_flydsl()`. `swiglu_limit` is normalized to 7.0 for an unset
SwiGLU limit and `+inf` for an unset SiLU limit, but remains a runtime scalar
rather than a builder parameter.

For fp4/fp8 weights, the next builder is
`compile_mixed_moe_gemm1()`. For bf16 activations with int4 weights it is
`compile_moe_gemm1()` with `in_dtype="int4_bf16"`, group size 32, bf16 scale,
and CShuffle enabled automatically only for split-K.

For non-split-K `_fp4`/`_fp8` stage1 names, activation, optional route
weighting, quantization, and sorted E8M0-scale emission are fused into the
primary GEMM artifact.

### Split-K auxiliary activation and quantization

`k_batch > 1` makes the primary FlyDSL GEMM write bf16/fp16 gate/up partials
into a zeroed `[token, topk, 2 * inter_dim]` buffer. Therefore the primary
builder receives the base output dtype, even when the requested final stage1
output is fp4 or fp8. Post-processing is selected as follows:

| Runtime predicate | Post-processing artifact |
| --- | --- |
| interleaved gate/up and final fp4/fp8 | `build_silu_and_mul_fq_module(inter_dim, topk, quant_mode="fp4" or "fp8", gui_layout=True, act, enable_bias)` |
| interleaved gate/up and no final quantization | the same builder with `quant_mode="none"` and `gui_layout=True` |
| separated gate/up and final fp4 | the same builder with `quant_mode="fp4"` and `gui_layout=False` |
| every other split-K case | CK/HIP `silu_and_mul`, `swiglu_and_mul`, or bias variant at runtime; no auxiliary FlyDSL artifact |

The FlyDSL helper owns activation, split-K result consumption, optional bias,
optional fp4/fp8 quantization, and sorted scale output. Split-K bias requires
`topk_ids`, because `sorted_token_ids` encodes token/slot but not expert ID.
The bias-presence boolean is a compile parameter; the bias shape and
`swiglu_limit` are runtime arguments.

Under `COMPILE_ONLY=1`, the non-FlyDSL plain split-K activation is deliberately
skipped after the primary GEMM compile.

## CK-Tile stage1 with a FlyDSL epilogue

`cktile_moe_stage1()` itself calls the CK-Tile/HIP
`aiter.moe_cktile2stages_gemm1`; it is not a FlyDSL GEMM.
A separate post-activation step exists only when `split_k > 1`.

The result is treated as interleaved when
`post_activation_layout="interleaved"`, or when
`post_activation_layout="auto"` and `w1.dtype` is
`torch.float4_e2m1fn_x2`. `"standard"` explicitly disables the interleaved
route.

- Interleaved SwiGLU calls
  `flydsl_swiglu_and_mul_interleaved()` and builds
  `build_swiglu_and_mul_module(inter_dim)`. Its request does not include
  `topk`.
- Interleaved SiLU calls
  `flydsl_silu_and_mul_interleaved()` and builds
  `build_silu_and_mul_fq_module(inter_dim, topk, quant_mode="none",
  gui_layout=True, act="silu", enable_bias=False)`.
- Interleaved GELU is implemented with PyTorch tensor operations, not FlyDSL.
- Standard-layout SiLU/SwiGLU/GELU and bias variants call AITER activation
  operators, not FlyDSL. Interleaved split-K bias is rejected.
- Non-split-K CK-Tile keeps activation in the CK-Tile epilogue and does not
  reach either FlyDSL helper.

The current CSV AOT collector is intentionally broader than this runtime
predicate: any `kernelName1` beginning with `cktile_` emits an epilogue job,
without checking `split_k` or the runtime weight layout, and maps every
non-SwiGLU activation to SiLU. That is an old-path over-approximation, not a
new resolver contract.

## Stage2 and reduction compile requests

`_flydsl_stage2_wrapper()` resolves the stage2 kernel name and forwards its
registered parameters to `flydsl_moe_stage2()`. The primary
`compile_flydsl_moe_stage2()` request contains:

- `model_dim`, `inter_dim`, local `experts`, runtime `topk`;
- `tile_m`, `tile_n`, `tile_k`, activation/weight/output dtype tags;
- `doweight_stage2 = (sorted_weights is not None)`;
- `accumulate`, derived from configured mode and `return_per_slot`;
- `persist_m`, `sort_block_m`, `waves_per_eu`, `use_async_copy`,
  `cu_num_mul`, `b_nt`, and `xcd_swizzle`;
- model/intermediate padding and compile-time bias presence.

`doweight_stage1` determines routing-weight ownership: stage1 receives
`sorted_weights` when true; otherwise stage2 receives them. A configured
`mode="reduce"` makes `accumulate=False`. Atomic mode uses
`accumulate=True`, writes directly into the sorting-zeroed `[T, model_dim]`
buffer, and has no reduction artifact. `AITER_FLYDSL_FORCE_REDUCE=1` can
override an atomic name at runtime.

`persist_m` is runtime-derived:

- explicit `persist=True` -> `-1` (persistent CU grid);
- explicit `persist=False` -> 4 when `m_blocks > 256`, otherwise 1;
- unspecified -> `-1` when `m_blocks > 256`, otherwise 1;
- fp8 activation forces 1.

For reduce mode, GEMM2 writes a contiguous
`[token, topk, model_dim]` temporary and `_run_moe_reduction()` emits a second
FlyDSL request:

```text
compile_moe_reduction(
    topk=runtime_topk,
    model_dim=model_dim,
    dtype_str="f16" | "bf16" | "f32",
    use_mask=(expert_mask is not None),
    num_experts=expert_mask.numel() if masked else 0,
)
```

- Plain reduction sums every top-k slot.
- Expert-parallel masked reduction additionally gathers
  `expert_mask[topk_ids[token, slot]]` and sums only valid slots. Both
  `expert_mask` and `topk_ids` are normalized to contiguous int32 runtime
  inputs. Missing `topk_ids` is an error.
- An unsupported output dtype may use `torch.sum` only for the unmasked case;
  masked reduction rejects it. The standard output dtypes above use FlyDSL.

The runtime CSV lookup removes the EP fake slot from its key, but the actual
stage2 and reduction requests receive the runtime `topk`, including that slot.

## Parameter ownership summary

| Owner/source | Parameters and decisions |
| --- | --- |
| User/model tensors | `M`, runtime `topk`, local `E`, dimensions, tensor dtypes/layout, scales, biases, `expert_mask`, `num_local_tokens`, `swiglu_limit` |
| `fused_moe_` host logic | activation/quant dtype remapping, padded token tier, sorting backend eligibility, route-weight stage, inter-stage quantization, empty vs zeroed `moe_buf` |
| Tuned CSV row | `block_m`, `ksplit`, `kernelName1`, `kernelName2`; row match also depends on architecture, shape, activation, dtypes, quant type, gate/up shape, and route-weight stage |
| Kernel-name registry | stage, tile sizes, dtype tags, stage1 `k_batch`/gate mode/schedule knobs, stage2 atomic/reduce mode, `sort_block_m`, persistence and schedule variants |
| Stage entry functions | exact compile dimensions, presence booleans, effective split-K output dtype, persistent-mode threshold, argument packing, auxiliary helper selection |
| Sorting host code | oneshot threshold, `max_tokens` bucket, multiphase family, workspace size, `k4_block`, mask variant |
| Environment/runtime architecture | FlyDSL availability, sorting backend flags, force-reduce/heuristic debug flags, CU count, ROCm architecture and wave size |
| Current AOT adapter | CSV enumeration/deduplication, fake tensor shapes, target arch from `cu_num`, and compile-only execution; it does not own production dispatch semantics |

Pointer signatures do not encode scale or routing tensor lengths, and tensor
**presence** can still select compile-time booleans. One host-level exception
is stage2: `sorted_expert_ids.shape[0]` contributes to `m_blocks`, which can
change the derived `persist_m` request. Sorting also uses its token bucket,
expert count, top-k, mask presence, unit size, and architecture to select an
artifact.

## FlyDSL and non-FlyDSL boundary

- **FlyDSL:** selected standard stage1/stage2 GEMMs, split-K
  `silu_and_mul_fq`, CK-Tile interleaved SiLU/SwiGLU epilogues, stage2
  reduction, and opt-in sorting.
- **CK/HIP:** opt-in CK sorting, CK/CK-Tile stage GEMMs, ordinary split-K
  activation helpers, and the `get_hip_quant` family used before stage1 and
  between stages when quantization is not fused by FlyDSL stage1.
- **Opus:** default standard sorting when CK sorting is not forced, local-ID
  and some auxiliary sorting routes, plus tuned Opus stage2 rows.
- **Host/PyTorch:** tensor allocation/view logic, unsupported plain reduction
  fallback, and CK-Tile interleaved GELU.

Backend mixing is expected. A FlyDSL stage1 does not imply a FlyDSL stage2,
and FlyDSL sorting is an independent opt-in.

## Transitional AOT route and baseline contract

The current [`aiter/aot/flydsl/moe.py`](../aiter/aot/flydsl/moe.py) route is
transitional:

1. It enumerates CSV rows and resolves `flydsl_` kernel names through the
   current registry. It also emits broad CK-Tile epilogue jobs and both
   supported bias-presence variants for eligible fp4-weight rows. Unlike
   runtime lookup, this parser does not discard `_tag=flydsl_fallback` rows,
   so it can over-collect jobs from them.
2. It selects `FLYDSL_GPU_ARCH` from `cu_num` (`80`/`304` -> gfx942,
   `256` -> gfx950, otherwise gfx950).
3. Under `FakeTensorMode` and `COMPILE_ONLY=1`, it creates top-level stage
   placeholders with `build_stage1_compile_inputs()` or
   `build_stage2_compile_inputs()` and invokes `flydsl_moe_stage1/2`.
4. The real stage host functions still own argument packing, the primary
   builder call, split-K auxiliary builders, and stage2 reduction.

Although routing pointer lengths are not part of the FlyDSL argument
signature, the placeholder `sorted_expert_ids` length can still cross
stage2's `m_blocks > 256` host threshold and change `persist_m`. The
`_aot_routing_placeholder()` docstring refers to
`aiter/aot/flydsl/_cache_key_parity.py`, but that guard is not present on this
branch. The checked-in request golden therefore includes otherwise-matching
small and large plain-reduce scenarios; the large scenario records the
threshold-derived `persist_m=-1` request explicitly.

This adapter bypasses `fused_moe_`, configuration lookup, quantization, and
sorting; it is therefore neither a complete production call graph nor a
Manifest source. In particular, sorting still touches CUDA properties/streams
and is not driven by this direct stage AOT route. The adapter also supplies no
`expert_mask`/`topk_ids` to stage2, so a reduce row compiles the plain
reduction only; the masked reduction must be covered by the old-host-path
baseline.

The CPU baseline recorder enters the existing `flydsl_moe_stage1/2`,
epilogue, and sorting host paths through production input builders and
wrappers. It does not reimplement or execute `fused_moe_` configuration
selection; those predicates remain the inventory contract above. With fake
tensors and mocked compile/launch/CUDA boundaries, the test normalizes complete
public builder kwargs plus a stable trigger ID and compares the exact request
set with the checked-in gfx950 golden. It must not snapshot FlyDSL-private cache
keys.
That golden is a regression oracle for a future resolver: intentional old-path
changes require an explicit reviewed golden update; incidental ordering,
pointer values, launcher state, or cache implementation details do not.

### Checked-in trigger matrix

The golden's stable trigger IDs map to this inventory as follows. A trigger can
emit more than one request when the host path builds a primary GEMM plus an
auxiliary artifact, or when sorting constructs both launcher families before
selecting one.

- Stage1 primary builders:
  `stage1.main.non_split.bias.route_weighted`,
  `stage1.int4.splitk`,
  `stage1.splitk.fp4.silu.separated`,
  `stage1.splitk.fp8.swiglu.interleaved.bias`, and
  `stage1.splitk.none.silu.interleaved`.
  These cover mixed-MX and standard int4 GEMM1, route weighting, primary bias,
  both gate layouts, and all three split-K post-activation quant modes.
- CK-Tile FlyDSL epilogues:
  `cktile.epilogue.silu` and `cktile.epilogue.swiglu`.
- Stage2:
  `stage2.atomic.bias`, `stage2.int4.atomic`,
  `stage2.reduce.plain`, `stage2.reduce.plain.large_auto_persist`, and
  `stage2.reduce.masked_ep`.
  These cover mixed-MX and standard int4 GEMM2, atomic and reduce modes, the
  automatic persistence threshold, and plain/masked reduction.
- Sorting:
  `sorting.oneshot.unmasked`, `sorting.oneshot.masked`,
  `sorting.multiphase.p0v2.unmasked.e384`, and
  `sorting.multiphase.4k.masked`.
  The E384 case records the reachable `k4_block=512` multiphase specialization;
  the E256 cases retain `k4_block=256`.

Requests are sorted by stable ID before serialization, dictionaries are emitted
with sorted keys, and non-finite floats use explicit string spellings. Repeated
recordings therefore produce byte-identical canonical JSON without depending
on import or scenario declaration order.
